                <p class="text">From creating simple mods for Fallout 3 and New Vegas, to making a simple Unity World in VR chat for you and your friends to play around in, sounds pretty simple right? The correct answer is no, I was way in over my head and 3 years later I'm a <span id="ree">Freelance 3D Artist</span>, doing <span id="ree">Hardsurface</span> to <span id="ree">Enviromental</span> arts and abit of <span id="ree">Creative Direction</span> consulting on the side, I never knew I'd be writing my own full length animated series and trying to build my own game and animation studio, as a child it was a dream, now I'm on the road to making it a reality.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text">My own personal mission is to create and provide entertaining, narratively deep, fun and touching experiences for people to enjoy, with everything I create. Whatever I produce, I always step back and look upon finishing it to self criticise and raise my own personal expectations of myself to push myself to make better and higher quality work from that point on, never settling for the same standard or lesser standard that what I've produced before, there's always room for improvement, more efficient ways and methods of doing things, settling for anything less isn't an option for me and is something that I do pride myself with holding myself to always do better.</p>
